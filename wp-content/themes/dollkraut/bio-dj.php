            If there’s one thing that Dollkraut can’t stand, it’s predictability. For the past decade, Pascal Pinkert has passionately pursued musical unpredictability. In the process, he’s earned a reputation for being a DJ and producer whose fuzzy, lo-fi and analogue-rich approach giddily sidesteps conventions and proudly nestles in the cracks between genres.
            Eschewing narrow-mindedness while embracing experimental and DIY sounds, Pinkert is capable of sending dancefloors wild with records that few other DJs would dare to drop. While his focus remains firmly on records you can dance to, few would be able to second-guess his set-lists.
            This approach has resulted in a string of memorable DJ appearances at such iconic clubs and events as Rock En Seine in Paris, the Institut fur Die Zukunft in Leipzig, Tel Aviv’s Breakfast Club and Dekmantel Selectors festival in Tisno, Croatia. Fittingly, Pinkert also now hosts a regular Dollkraut show on Amsterdam institution Red Light Radio.
            As you’d expect, unpredictability is also at the heart of Pinkert’s musical productions. Since making his debut in 2009, the Dutchman has brought his distinctive, anything-goes style to a stellar list of labels, including Permanent Vacation, The Gym, Tape Records Amsterdam, Charlois and, most recently, Jennifer Cardini and Noura Labbani’s Dischi Autunno.
            Delve deep into his discography – and in particular his two albums, Schimanski’s Black Lullabies (The Gym, 2014) and Holy Ghost People (Dischi Autunno, 2017) and you’ll find a dizzying range of hazy, otherworldly and mind-altering sounds. These mine the past for inspiration whilst offering a glimpse of an imagined future fraying at the seams.
            From muscular electronic disco, Morricone-inspired cinematic soundscapes and dub-flecked krautrock workouts, to electro-fired post-punk and wave, ghostly pop and freaky synthesizer explorations, Pinkert’s music surprises and thrills at every turn. Given this gleefully rough-round-the-edges eclecticism, the recent revelation that he is also the man behind Knekelhuis’s celebrated minimal wave project, De Ambassade, cannot have come as a shock.
            As for Pinkert’s future plans, you’ll just have to wait and see. If his career so far has taught us anything, he’ll most likely continue confounding expectations.
